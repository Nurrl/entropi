# anarpi
Tool used to modify RaspberryPi image automatically, to make it secure and almost undetecable on network.

# Why this name ?
'pi' is for the RaspberryPi, and 'anar' is for the anarchy this kind of backdoor can cause on a network ;D (can also be called 'entropi', comment on issue #1 to vote ^^)

# Dependencies
```
  - qemu-user-static
  - wget
  - fdisk
```
